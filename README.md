## 📌 Overview
The **Innoflo Operational Data Project** is a machine learning initiative focused on enhancing **operational efficiency** and **reliability** in the fluid delivery sector.  
Developed as part of a **Machine Learning Work-Integrated Project 1** experience (January – April 2025), the project investigates the impact of **environmental** and **operational** factors on delivery performance.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a predictive analytics solution capable of:
- 🔮 **Forecasting potential delivery delays**
- ⚠️ **Predicting equipment failure risk**

---

## 📂 Data Description

The project utilizes a combination of **anonymized operational data** and **weather data**. Key features include:

- ⏱️ Timestamps and durations  
- 🏷️ Equipment identifiers and categories  
- 🌡️ Environmental indicators (temperature, precipitation, etc.)  
- 📈 Performance metrics  

> 🔒 **Note**: All data used was anonymized and handled in compliance with data privacy guidelines.

## 🧠 Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and formatted raw datasets  
- Handled missing values and standardized units  
- Merged multiple datasets for comprehensive analysis  

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Generated time-based and weather-related features  
- Derived key performance indicators  
- Encoded categorical variables  

### 3️⃣ Modeling
Developed both **regression** and **classification** models using:
- 🌲 Random Forest  
- ⚡ XGBoost  
- 📉 Logistic Regression  

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- RMSE  
- ROC-AUC  
- Cross-validation  

### 4️⃣ Deployment
- Created an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**
- Allows users to input operational and environmental conditions
- Displays real-time prediction results and trend visualizations

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 🐍 **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- 🎨 **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- 🌐 **Dashboard**: Streamlit  
- ☁️ **Collaboration**: Google Drive, Notion  

---

## ✅ Key Deliverables

- 🤖 A working ML model to predict delivery delays and equipment failure  
- 🖥️ A user-friendly dashboard for real-time prediction and exploration  
- 📑 A documented end-to-end pipeline for future scaling and improvements  

---

## 🔮 Future Directions

- 🔌 Integration of **real-time data APIs**  
- 🌍 Expansion to additional **regions** and **equipment types**  
- 🚀 Full-scale deployment with **user testing** and feedback integration
